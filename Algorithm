An Efficient algorithm for generating prime numbers is Sieve of Eratosthenes.

It is an algorithm used to find prime numbers upto a given limit.
It does so by iteratively marking as composite (i.e., not prime) the multiples of each prime, starting with the first prime number, 2. 
The multiples of a given prime are generated as a sequence of numbers starting from that prime, with constant difference between them that
is equal to that prime. This is the sieve's key distinction from using trial division to sequentially test each number for 
divisibility by each prime.
