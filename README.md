PRIME NUMBERS

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. 
Primes numbers are central in number theory because of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: every natural number greater than 1 is
either a prime itself or can be factorized as a product of primes that is unique up to their order. 
The property of being prime is called primality.
